Digital twins have emerged as a promising technology for the real-time simulation and replication
of the physical behavior of robotic systems. In this research, the development and implementation
of digital twins for robotic manipulators using ROS-Gazebo software simulation is presented. Two
simple 2 degree-of-freedom robotic arms, the Quanser 2DOF Serial Flexible Link and the Philips
Experimental Robot Arm, as well as a robot with 7 degrees of freedom are studied and their digital
twins are developed. Three different controllers are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
ROS as a digital twin platform for control. They are compared with the experimental results and with
Simulink. Trajectory tracking for a specific case in the industry is the main focus. The system is mod-
eled in the port-Hamiltonian framework for mechanical systems and the Euler-Lagrange.


The effectiveness of digital twins for control and validation of robotic manipulators is demonstrated
in the experimental results. Accurate and reliable simulation results are provided by the digital twins,
which can be used to test and validate the control algorithms of the robotic manipulator. Insights into
the usability, problems, and the research future are shown by the results.
